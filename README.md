# Disclaimer 

The reason I created this script is to make it easier for you to download charts from Phira. Recently, the Phira server has been experiencing several problems, making it very slow to download chart, that's why i got the idea to make a ts script
actually I'm not good at python, so almost all the code is done by AI, so I just use my ideas and implement them through AI,
Thank you
